= Information Modeling Using EXPRESS -- The EXPRESS course by Peter Wilson

== Introduction

This course will initiate any novice in EXPRESS modeling through a series of
tutorials and exercises.

Competance in EXPRESS comes with training -- learn it, use it, be fluent in it
-- just like any other language!

This course was originally developed in May 2004.


== Course order

The following course order is suggested:

* Part 1: An Introduction. The "Ambiguities" and "Simple models"
  exercises can be used during this.

* Part 2: EXPRESS-G.

* Exercises

** Split the audience into groups to develop EXPRESS-G models for the
  "Car Registration Authority" (`egspec.pdf` handout).

** Get each group to present its model to the others. Present/handout
  `egcarsg.pdf` and `egcarsx.pdf`.

** Allow about 1/2 day for exercises.

* Part 3: Advanced EXPRESS (`advexpv` & `advexpvtn`)

* Part 4: RULES (`rulesv` & `rulesvtn`)

** (Can be skipped if the class is too bored)

* "Principles" (`principlesv`)

Overall about two days will be required.


== Contents

=== General

Document sources have been written using LaTeX, plus some
MetaPost drawings borrowed from the EXPRESS Edition 2 FDIS.

Teaching materials are in the form of PDF files. There is a single
version of those that are intended as printed handouts. Materials intended
to be shown on a screen to an audience come in two versions;

. Filenames ending with `v` are for viewgraphs

. Filenames ending with `vtn` are for the instructor and include notes
  as well as the viewgraphs (the font sizes in these are smaller than
  in the viewgraph only files).

=== Part 1: An Introduction

Output files:

* `expv.pdf`
* `expvtn.pdf`

=== Examples

"Example model statement: Car Registration Authority"

* `egspec.pdf` (from `egspec.tex`)

"EXPRESS-G example model: Registration Authority"

* `egcarsg.pdf` (from `egcarsg.tex`)

"EXPRESS example model: Registration Authority"

* `egcarsx.pdf` (from `egcarsx.tex`)


=== Supporting files

* Files `*.sty` are LaTeX package files

* Files with numeric extensions are metapost generated EPS for diagrams,
  files `*.mp` and `*.mpx` are also metapost related

* Files `pl*.tex` and `ps*.tex` contain LaTeX diagrams


== Usage

=== Prerequisites

* latexmk
* Metapost (the `mpost` command)


=== Compiling TeX documents

Run `latexmk` within the `tex/` folder. The provided `latexmkrc` should just work.

= The EXPRESS-G language

== EXPRESS-G

EXPRESS-G is a graphical subset of EXPRESS lexical language and
has evolved from a variety of sources.

10/88:: EXPRESSAM (Bruce Lownsbery, Lawrence Livermore Lab)
based on NIAM.
2/89:: GREXP (Peter Wilson, GE) BLA  (boxes, lines, annotation) with
multiple levels of abstraction and any amount of text.
11/89:: ExpressGraph (Curt Parks, NIST & John Zimmerman, Allied Bendix)
simplified version of EXPRESSAM.
2/90:: EXPRESS-G (EXPRESS Committee)


== EXPRESS-G

* Drafted by EXPRESS Committee in January 1990
* A combination of ExpressGraph and GREXP.
* A _subset_ of EXPRESS.
* Modeling of Entity, Attribute, Cardinality, Supertype, Type and Schema.
* Limited levels of abstraction.
* No ISO ballot issues in mid 1990 (Informative Annex).
* February 1991 --  Normative Annex to EXPRESS document and
extended.
* Same standardization status as EXPRESS.


== EXPRESS-G Design Goals

* Subset of EXPRESS.
* Intuitive understanding of diagrams.
* Support different levels of abstraction.
* Mechanism for multi-page models.
* Minimal graphic capabilities needed.
* Potential automatic EXPRESS-G display of EXPRESS models.

== Usage

* Graphical display of EXPRESS models.
* Stand-alone information modeling iconic language.
* Model display at varying levels of abstraction.
* Model display at varying levels of granularity.
